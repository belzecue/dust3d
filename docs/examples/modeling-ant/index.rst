Modeling Ant using Dust3D
---------------------------

Prepare Reference Sheet
=======================
You can start modeling without any reference, however, if you model on top of a turnaround reference sheet, the final result would be better, it also ease the progress of modeling.
The recommended features for reference sheet in Dust3D:

* Only one image, but include at least two profiles in the image, one for front view, one for side view. And align horizontally with the same height.
* Image size less than 1MB. Because if you save the document, the reference image will also be included in the .ds3 file.
* No blur filter, make a clean sheet, Dust3D will blur it for you when you load the image.

The above reference is a good example. The raw picture comes from https://www.antweb.org/bigPicture.do?name=casent0103346&shot=d&number=1 Composed in GIMP.

Modeling in Dust3D
=====================

#. Load Reference Sheet from Menu: File > Change Turnaround...
#. Click Plus(+) Icon from Tool Box
#. Place node on the canvas according to the reference background.
#. Use Mouse Wheel to Adjust the radius of the node, hold shift to slow down the scroll scale.
#. Use the Parts List panel to toggle the settings to make you easily select or see nodes.
#. Use Mouse Middle button plus Shift key to rotate and move around the Rendered Model.
